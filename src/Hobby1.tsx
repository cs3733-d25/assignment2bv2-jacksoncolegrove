            <h1>Hey! my Name is Jackson and my Hobby is Rowing.</h1>
            <h4>Welcome to my Page About Rowing!</h4>
            <p> Hello, my name is Jackson. I am a Robotics and Mechanical engineering major at WPI.
                I grew up in Sacramento, California and have a younger brother, a dog, and two cats.
                I enjoy many different sports, such as baseball, water polo, basketball and rowing.
                I also enjoy the outdoors and often camp and hike with my family.
                I recently hiked Mt. Lassen, which had a great view.
            </p>

                Rowing dates back to ancient civilizations, where it was used for transportation and warfare. In the medieval era,
                galleys powered by forced labor became common. Today, rowing is a popular sport that emphasizes teamwork, strength,
                and technique, enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether for fitness or fun,
                itâ€™s a rewarding hobby that connects you with nature.
