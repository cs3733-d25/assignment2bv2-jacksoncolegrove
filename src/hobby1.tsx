                Rowing dates back to ancient civilizations, where it was used for transportation and warfare. In the medieval era,
                galleys powered by forced labor became common. Today, rowing is a popular sport that emphasizes teamwork, strength,
                and technique, enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether for fitness or fun,
                itâ€™s a rewarding hobby that connects you with nature.
